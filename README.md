# IDIA â€“ Convert Fits datacubes to DDS

Scripts to convert spectroscopic datacubes to DDS format for use in VR and other visualisation environments.

**slice.py** uses [Astropy](http://www.astropy.org) and [PIL](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Pillow/4.2.1)

The **makedds** command relies on the *texassemble* utility included in [DirectXTex](https://github.com/Microsoft/DirectXTex). It takes a series of .tiff images as input and outputs a 3-dimensional DDS file of the same bit-depth as the input images.

Adding the built *texassemble.exe* to the Windows PATH makes is executable from anywhere.
